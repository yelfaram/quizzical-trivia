# Scrimba - Quizzical Trivia
This is my solution to the [Quizzical Trivia solo project on Scrimba](https://scrimba.com/learn/learnreact)

## Overview
Quizzical is a trivia game implemented using React. Trivia questions are retrieved from [Open Trivia Database API](https://opentdb.com/api_config.php). When the game is started, user is presented with 4 random questions. After selecting an option
for each, user is then able to validate their answers as well as start a new game.

### Concepts
Through this solo project, I was able to reinforce my knowledge of all the concepts I have learnt throughout the course. 

These are some of the concepts I've explored; there may be additional ones:
- Use of .map() and props
- Controlled components
- Event Listeners
- React State (useState)
- Conditional Rendering
- React Hooks (useEffect)
- Making API calls

## React + Vite
This project was created with [Vite](https://vitejs.dev/guide/)

This template provides a minimal setup to get React working in Vite with HMR and some ESLint rules.

Currently, two official plugins are available:

- [@vitejs/plugin-react](https://github.com/vitejs/vite-plugin-react/blob/main/packages/plugin-react/README.md) uses [Babel](https://babeljs.io/) for Fast Refresh
- [@vitejs/plugin-react-swc](https://github.com/vitejs/vite-plugin-react-swc) uses [SWC](https://swc.rs/) for Fast Refresh
